# Farcaster Collectible Cast Treasure

Smart contract that lets the owner of a [Farcaster collectible cast](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/collectible-casts) withdraw all of the assets in it.

The collectible (NFT) doesn't have to exist at the time of Treasure.sol being deployed because the token id is deterministic based on the cast hash.

## Farcaster Cast Collectible Treasure

ok time for an experiment

i'm going to write a smart contract that lets the winner of this cast's auction to claim 0.0135 ETH (~$50)

this is possible because the token id of the collectible is deterministic based on the cast hash, so it's totally permissionless

anybody can add to the prize as well

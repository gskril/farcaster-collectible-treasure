# Farcaster Collectible Cast Treasure

Smart contract that lets the owner of a [Farcaster collectible cast](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/collectible-casts) withdraw all of the assets in it.

This is possible because the collectible's token id is deterministic based on the cast hash, so it's totally permissionless.
